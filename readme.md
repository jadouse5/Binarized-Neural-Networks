## **Introduction**
This project demonstrates the implementation and performance of a Binarized Neural Network (BNN) on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. BNNs are neural networks with binary weights and, in some cases, binary activations, making them computationally efficient and well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Larq

Ensure you have the above software and libraries installed before running the notebook.

## **Installation**
To set up the environment for running this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Jupyter using pip:
   ```
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib larq
   ```

## **Running the Notebook**
To run the notebook, navigate to the directory containing the `.ipynb` file in your terminal or command prompt, and execute the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the `binarized-neural-network-mnist.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface in your browser.

## **Notebook Contents**
The notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Introduction to BNNs:** A brief overview of BNNs and their advantages.
2. **Loading the MNIST Dataset:** Instructions on how to load and preprocess the data.
3. **Building the BNN Model:** Steps to define and compile the BNN model.
4. **Training the Model:** Training the BNN model on the MNIST dataset.
5. **Evaluation and Results:** Evaluating the model's performance and displaying the results.
6. **Conclusion:** Summary of the findings and potential future work.

## **Expected Outcomes**
Upon successful completion of the notebook, you should be able to understand the implementation details of a BNN, its application on the MNIST dataset, and observe its performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

## **Credits**
This project utilizes the [Larq](https://docs.larq.dev/larq/) library, an open-source deep learning library for training neural networks with extremely low precision weights and activations, such as Binarized Neural Networks. More information about Larq can be found on their [official documentation](https://docs.larq.dev/larq/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larq/larq).

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing Binarized Neural Networks. The MNIST dataset serves as an excellent benchmark to demonstrate the capabilities of BNNs in handling real-world tasks efficiently.
